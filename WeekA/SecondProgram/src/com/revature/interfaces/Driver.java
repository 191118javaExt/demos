	 * Interfaces are Java's means of sort of accomplishing
	 * multiple-inheritance, but not quite
	 * 
	 * interface is a keyword that can be used similarly to class
	 * Inside the brackets, you can declare methods and some static fields
	 * Note, the fields can only be static, they cannot be instance
	 * All methods in an interface are public abstract
	 * All fields in an interface are public static final
	 * 
	 * Classes use the implements keyword for interfaces
	 * Classes can implement MULTIPLE interfaces
	 * But classes can extend only ONE other class
	 * 
	 * Classes that implement an interface inherit the abstract methods
	 * and therefore, if the class is not abstract, must provide its own
	 * implementation
	 * 
	 * Abstract classes can still implement interfaces, they just inherit the
	 * abstract methods
	 * 
	 * Since abstract classes can still have concrete methods, the abstract class
	 * can provide an implementation for any interface methods it wants
	 * while leaving some others as abstract
