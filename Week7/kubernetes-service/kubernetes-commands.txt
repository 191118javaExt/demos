kubectl apply -f <deployment-filename>
kubectl get deployments # to check that it was successful
kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --name=<service-name> --type=<type>
	# If you're using minikube, you should use NodePort as the type
	# If you're using a real cluster, you should use LoadBalancer as the type
kubectl get services # to check services availability (and the external IP)
	# If you're using minikube with NodePort, you should instead run
		# minikube service <service-name> --url
	# This will give you an external ip to use
	# ignore the "pending" that 'kubectl get services' says

# Remember the syntax for the deployment file, it should be a yaml file
# Included is the deployment-file example
