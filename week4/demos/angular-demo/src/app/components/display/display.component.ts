  /*
    Observables and Promises are ways to make asynchronous calls.
    They are rather similar, but Observables are a bit more modern
    and used a bit more widely.
    Promises guarantee a response.
    Observables, while similar, do not.
    We can subscribe to these and perform some action when a response
    is received.

    Note *VERY IMPORTANT*: If you do not subscribe, then the request will NOT
    be sent!!!! It is only sent when the request is subscribed to.

    It is a VERY common mistake to forget to subscribe to your observables.
    Make sure you do this!
