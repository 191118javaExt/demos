        <!--  WHAT IS HIBERNATE?
        	Hibernate is an ORM and persistence framework
        	
        	What's are ORM
        			Object Relational Mapping. They take objects in programming 
        			languages and translate them into tables in your database 
        	What is persistence?
        		Storing your information/data in a form that is durable (in our DB)
        	WHAT are some benefits to Hibernate?
        	
        	As developers, we no longer have to write complex sql statements
        	It is object oriented
        	It's Fast
        		-It has caching, uses connection pools to minimize bottle necked speed
        		caused by forming db connections
        	Its modular, you can write code once and later change the sql 
        	language by only changing out the driver
        	-->

		<!--  COnnection Pool. A method of speeding up database calls. Hibernate will create 10
		connections to the database when it starts up and every time you create a session, the 
		session will borrow an active connection from the connection pool. WHen you close a session the
		connection doesn't close...It is simply freed up for another session to use.
		This speeds up database interactions. (Default size of the pool is 20)

		CREATE, VALIDATE, UPDATE, NONE 
		CREATE drops all existing tables and other object with the names you have provided in the 
		annotations, then hibernate will create your schema.
		(NOT PARTICULARLY GREAT FRO PRODUCATION. used for development. 
		VALIDATE checks to make sure the schema exists as expected.
		UPDATE hibernate will NOT delete anything, it'll only add to your schema if you need
		more objects.
		NONE wel... it means hibernate wont do anything to your schema automatically. 
		HOW DOES HIBERNATE INTERACT WITH YOUR SCHEMA: ..... QC
