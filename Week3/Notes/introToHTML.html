      is a newline character. Since the paragraph tag
      ignores all whitespace except for spaces, this is
      how we get new lines.
      Additionally, I have made it a self-closing tag
      This is accomplished by putting a forward slash before
      the > symbol. -->

    <h1>HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
    <!--
      Semantic tags are tags that are named in a specific way so that
      they are easier to read by humans. They help discern the intentions
      of the developer who wrote the html document.
      Note that they are not different from regular tags, they just
      aim to more clearly communicate the purpose of the segment of html.

      Examples: header, footer, nav, article, etc.
    -->

    <header>
      <h1>I am in a header</h1>
      <p>Usually, this would be at the top of a webpage.</p>
    </header>

    <footer>
      <h2>This is my footer</h2>
      <p>Usually, this would be at the bottom of a webpage.</p>
    </footer>

    <!-- Nav is usually used to enclose a section that has links
      .... You know, like a navbar -->

    <nav>
      <h1>Navigate to these links if you want!</h1>
      <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>
      <a href="https://google.com">Yahoo!</a>
      <a href="https://google.com">Bing</a>
      <a href="https://google.com">Search Engine #4</a>
    </nav>
    <!-- Attributes -->
    <!--
      An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element.
        - Attributes are placed within the element's opening tag
        - All attributes are made up of 2 parts: name and a value
          - The name is the property that you want to set
          - The value is what you want the property to be set to
    -->
    <p align="left">This paragraph is left aligned</p>
    <p align="center">This paragraph is center aligned</p>
    <p align="right">This paragraph is right aligned</p>

    <h3>Title attribute</h3>
    <!--
      The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element
        - The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element
          that carries it.
        - The example below will create an element that will summon a
          tooltip when the cursors hovers over the element
    -->
    <h4 title="This is my first title attribute!">Hover over me!</h4>

    <h3>The ID attribute</h3>
    <!--
      The id attribute of an html tag can be used to uniquely identify
      that tag within an html page.
      There are 2 main reasons why you would want to use an id:
        1) If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier,
            it is possible to identify just that element and its content
            for use in things like JavaScript.
        2) if you have 2 elements of the same name within a web page, you
            can distinguish between them
    -->

    <h2>The Style attribute</h2>
    <!--
      The style attribute can of course be used to style individual elements
      in miscellaneous ways. Such as coloring the text, or changing the font
      and many others.
    -->
    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:lightblue">Some text...</p>

    <h2>HTML forms</h2>

    <!--
      HTML forms
      Forms can be used when you want to collect information from the site
      visitor.
      - A form will take input and then it will post it to a back-end of your
        application (we'll do this, but not quite today)
      - Your back-end application will perform some required processing on the
        data that was passed in based on defined business logic inside the
        application
      - Various form elements that are available
    -->

    <form action=""> <!-- Action describes what you want to do with the form data -->
      Username:<br>
      <input type="text" name="username" value="user"/><br>
