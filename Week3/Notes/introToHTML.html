    <p>This is a paragraph, used to display lots of text.
      Generally, HTML will ignore large whitespace, except for spaces.







      I have put many blank lines above. Let's see how the browser will

    <!-- The above tag is called a line break. It
      is a newline character. Since the paragraph tag
      ignores all whitespace except for spaces, this is
      how we get new lines.
      Additionally, I have made it a self-closing tag
      This is accomplished by putting a forward slash before
      the > symbol. -->
