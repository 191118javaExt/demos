    <h1>Intro to CSS</h1>
    <p>
      So now we have a good understanding of HTML, but the last page still looked
      pretty ugly. The browser applies some default styling with certain tags, like
      holding <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags, but we were still looking at a very
      basic document - no colors, no other fonts, no spacing, etc. So how do we actually
      <em>style</em> the page to make it look nicer? We use <strong>CSS</strong>!
    </p>

    <p>
      CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>. It is a way of styling
      html elements in many different ways. It follows certain rules that we define.
      There are three ways to include CSS in an html page.
      <ol>
        <li>Inline</li>
        <li>Using internal stylesheets</li>
        <li>Using external stylesheets</li>
      </ol>

      What we saw in the previous introToHTML.html file was an example of
      inline styling.

      It can be performed on any html element with the <code>style</code> attribute.
      Within the quotations, we define the value of the style using CSS rules. CSS rules
      are key-value pairs separated by a colon ( : ). There are many CSS rules that you
      can apply, we will go over a few, but further self-exploration is required.
      We'll start with the <code style="color:rgb(27, 172, 47)">color</code> rule, which will change text color.
    </p>

    <span style="color:blueviolet">Some text in a span.</span>
    <span style="color:blueviolet; background-color:orange;">Some text with an
      orange background</span>

    <span style="color:white">Here is some white text, you probably cannot read
      this</span>
    <span style="color:aquamarine">You can read this.</span>

    <p>Note that CSS rules are separated by semicolons ( ; )</p>

    <h2>Internal Stylesheets</h2>

    <p>We can declare a style tag in the head tag of this html document.
        It will declare some overall styles for this entire html document.
    </p>

    <p>If you look above, you'll see in the head of the document, a style tag.
      This will declare our styling to whatever elements are declared in the style
      tag. This is called a stylesheet. We use CSS selectors followed by a curly brace
      with multiple styling rules separated by semicolons. The CSS selector is a name
      of a tag, for example, the <code>body</code> tag.
      Note that this will affect ALL elements that are children of that tag as well.

      So the first CSS rule above applied to the body tag restricts the width of the
      body to only 800 pixels at a maximum and sets the margin to be automatically
      calculated, which centers the element within it's parent.
      This is why our page looks like one single column down the middle.

      The final rule specifies the font family as Helvetica, but with multiple provided
      with a comma. So that if the browser does not support one, it can use the next.
      Here, we prefer to use Helvetica and will fall back to Arial.

      As we saw earlier, CSS comments use the /* and */ similar to Java's multi-line
      comments.
    </p>

    <h2>Selectors</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          We just saw an example of a simple selector, which is of a tag name.
          For example, we could select all of our divs. For example, we just
          changed the text color to rebeccapurple and the background to green,
          then we set the width to 50% and centered it in the middle of the parent's
          width.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4>ID and Class Selectors</h4>
      <div id="div2">
        <p>
          We are able to select elements by more than just their tag.
          We can select elements that have a particular id, or a particular
          class. We select elements with a particular id using the hashtag #.
        </p>

        <p class="special special2">This paragraph has a particular class we have named
          special. We can apply styling to all elements with the "special" class
          by using a dot.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Please look into the following:
        <ol>
          <strong>
          <li>CSS Box Model</li>
          <li>Other Selectors such as Child and Descendant</li>
          <li>Sibling Selectors</li>
          <li>Units</li></strong>
          <li>Psuedo Class and Psuedo Element selectors</li>
          <li>Combining Selectors and Wildcards</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
  </body>
</html>
