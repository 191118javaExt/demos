## Reminder

Remember that QC will likely also ask questions about SQL, so make sure you still remember the information from the previous week. Our interview/quiz will only be on what we talked about this week, which is outlined above.

Additionally, remember that this is only an outline, and that personal exploration is still recommended to understand how all of these topics are interconnected.
